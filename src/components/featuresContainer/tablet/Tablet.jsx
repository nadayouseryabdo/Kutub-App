            "Here they come!" Leda's voice vibrated in the ears of the four men
            with her. They stood with their helmets touching so they could talk,
            eyes looking down the rugged sweep of Copernicus to the force which
            came running upward against them. At their backs, the brutal heights
            of rock climbed for the stars, but they stood in a recess between
            looming crags, as good a defensive position as they could hope for.
            "Eight, nine—" Rikard strained his eyes through the queer tricky
            light and shadow—the brilliant rushing blue of Earth nearly in full
            phase, the utter dark of knife-edged umbras, a sprawling savage
            confusion of spires and cliffs tumbling down toward the far ghostly
            shimmer of the plain. "Ten at least, I make it, probably more. It'll
            be a rough fight." The tiny metal-glinting specks bounded closer,
            twenty-foot leaps from height to height, and now they could see the
            sheen of Earthglow on spears and axes. Rikard said slowly: "It will
            most likely be death if we make a stand. Let anyone who wishes go
            down to them now, and I will not think the less of him." "Down to
            execution or enslavement? You should know us better than that," said
            Huw. He hefted his own ax, and shadows crept over the folds of his
            flexicord suit. "Heh, they'll have to come at us only a few at a
            time. We'll mince 'em as they do." A mutter of assent rumbled from
            Jonak and Chungti. Leda remained silent, but one gauntletted hand
            closed on Rikard's arm. The outlaw chief's gaunt dark face flashed
            in a brief grin. "Thank you," he said. "We'll at least show the
            damned Copers that Nyrac can still fight." He moved away from the
            group and strung his bow. It was a big one, suitable for the giant
            who wielded it, and had been in his family for a long time. Plastic
            bow, wire string, steel arrows that leaped out with a hundred pounds
            of force behind them—such a weapon could pierce a spacesuit and come
            out the other side in a rush of air. Wood and cord were of little
            use on the surface; they dried and cracked in the sucking vacuum,
            sizzled by day and froze by night. But with this weapon he had sent
            more men than he remembered to Earth. Standing in the abysmal shadow
            of a crag, he nocked an arrow and took aim. The bow thrummed in his
            hand and a bright shaft sprang forth. One of the attacking band
            suddenly leaped up, fell, and rolled down the long slope with the
            moisture-laden air gushing out like his fleeing soul. "There's one
            less!" cried Leda savagely, and raised her pike. None heard her
            speak in the looming silence, but they saw her lips laughing behind
            the plastic helmet. Rikard turned for a glimpse of her, the strong
            fair face, the heavy yellow hair—turned blue and green now by the
            pouring Earthlight, but not the less good to look on. He had stolen
            her three years before, in a raid on Moonburg, and she had fought
            him bitterly for awhile. But later there had been understanding
            between them, and when the Copers overran Nyrac and he and a few men
            fled into rebellious exile, she was the only one of his wives who
            had come with him. They smiled briefly at each other and then he
            faced back toward the enemy. His bow throbbed again, and he cursed
            as the shaft whipped past a nearing figure. The man hurled a spear;
            it bounced off the crag and Huw stepped forth to seize and throw it
            back. Rikard fired once more, and another warrior tumbled to the
            stony ground, to freeze in death. Now they were close, terribly
            close, a good dozen of them rushing in on him. He sent a final
            snapped shot against them, dropped the bow, and grabbed up his ax.
            Swiftly the outlaws fell into a defending line: Rikard, Huw, and
            Jonak, the heaviest, standing shoulder to shoulder between the two
            great pillars; Leda and Chungti just behind them with pikes at the
            ready. The first of the Copers hit Rikard with the furious velocity
            of a broad jump, ax swinging down against the chief's helmet. Rikard
            caught the blow on his own weapon's handle, twisted it down, and
            kicked the attacker in the belly. He bounced away, wide open for
            assault, but it wouldn't do to leave the line. The next was almost
            instantly on the outlaw, blade cleaving vacuum. Rikard's ax blurred
            down and crashed into the space helmet. The shock of the blow rammed
            home in his own muscles, but it had burst open the tough plastic.
            Air whirled out, white with frost, red with the blood that suddenly
            foamed from mouth and nose. The enemy's own ax had dropped from his
            fingers as Rikard's blade smashed home, and clanged off the chief's
            helmet. Rikard smote at the warrior beyond, hit a metal shoulder
            plate, and dodged a counterblow. Leda thrust between him and Jonak,
            driving the pike home with a terrible force that split the Coper's
            suit at the belly. He lurched back, clutching futile hands against
            the streaming air, his face distorted with unheard screams. Two of
            them were on Rikard now, ax and spear, blows clattering off his
            helmet and shoulder plates as he dodged and parried and hewed. He
            whirled his weapon over his head, brought it crashing down to break
            another helmet and the skull beneath, and his own yelling rang in
            his ears. From the corner of one eye he saw Jonak fall. Snarling, he
            swung on the killer, his blow parried by the other axhead. "Go to
            Mars, you bastard!" he growled, and hailed blow after blow against
            the enemy's guard, a leaping dancing fury of steel that drove the
            fellow back until he was against a cliff. Rikard sprang in and slew
            him. Panting, he whirled around to see that the Copers had broken
            his line, that they raged three or four about each of the survivors,
            thrusting and smiting, a flicker of light and hard metal against the
            monstrous blacknesses of shadow. Even as he watched, Chungti went
            down with a spear in him. Huw and Leda stood back to back, beating
            off the pack that snarled around them, and Rikard launched himself
            across the space between to fall on the Copers. He clove one helmet
            from behind, pitched another man aside, parried a thrust and kicked
            the thruster back, and joined his comrades. A cloudiness of freezing
            moisture fogged his helmet, and Huw toppled against him. He stood
            over the body and struck home. Leda swept her pike in a wide arc,
            got it between a man's legs and tripped him, and stabbed him before
            he could rise. Then a Coper got between her and Rikard, threw his
            arms around her from behind and dragged her to the ground. They
            closed in on Rikard, hemming him in a solid wall of armored bodies,
            bearing him down and holding him fast with four men on each arm.
            When they brought forth wire and began lashing his hands together he
            kicked out, rose to his feet and knocked them away as they came on
            him, until someone else tackled him and he went down once more.
            Captured! By the living Earth, no clean death in battle, but
            captured! He lay gasping the hot foul air of his suit, looking up to
            the crystal dark of heaven, a million needle-sharp stars and the
            ghostly glory of the Milky Way, up to Earth's huge blue disc, and
            the world, the Moon-world of witchlight and shadow and cruel fanged
            stone, reeled about him with his dismay. Captured! A tall man,
            apparently the chief of the band, counted the survivors and then put
            his helmet against Rikard's. His face was sharply carved, dark-eyed,
            with the pointed beard of a Coper noble and the hollow cheeks
            corpse-blue in the light. He said slowly: "Yes, you are the rebel
            leader. I'm glad we took you alive." Rikard looked sullenly back at
            him. "Behave yourself," advised the other. "Remember we hold the
            woman too."
